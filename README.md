# Refactoring Trees
### An exercise for a course in Research Software Development in Python, at UCL.

In this exercise, we will convert badly written code, provided here, into better-written code. We will do this not through simply writing better code, but by taking a refactoring approach, as discussed in the lectures.
As such, we use of git version control, to make a commit after each step of the refactoring, with a commit message which indicates the refactoring you took, will be critical to success.
